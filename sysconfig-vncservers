# The VNCSERVERS variable is a list of display:user pairs.
#
# Uncomment the lines below to start a VNC server on display :2 as
# 'myusername' (adjust this to your own).  You will also need to set a
# VNC password; run 'man vncpasswd' to see how to do that.
#
# DO NOT RUN THIS SERVICE if your local area network is untrusted! For
# a secure way of using VNC, look for 'sshvnc' or other tools

# Use "-nolisten tcp" to prevent X connections to your VNC server via
# TCP.

# Use "-nohttpd" to prevent web-based VNC clients connecting.

# Use "-localhost" to prevent remote VNC clients connecting except when
# doing so through a secure tunnel.  See the "-via" option in the `man
# vncviewer' manual page.

# VNCSERVERS="2:myusername"
# VNCSERVERARGS[2]="-geometry 800x600 -nolisten tcp -localhost"
